# Module 9 Challenge
## SQL Challenge

### Objective
This project organizes the Pewlett Hackard employee database from the 1980s and 1990s using PostgreSQL.

The employee and company data was provided in 6 different csv files.  

The csv files are within this repository's [Resources](Resources) folder and contain the following information:
- Department Information
- Job Titles
- Employee Information
- Salary
- Employees by Department
- Managers by Department

Image files and SQL files are available in this repository's [EmployeeSQL](EmployeeSQL) folder.  

An [Entity Relationship Diagram](EmployeeSQL/ERD.png) was constructed using the website [Quick DBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/).
The tables have all data types, keys and key relationships, and other constraints defined.

The [table schemata](EmployeeSQL/table_schemata.sql) is available in a SQL file.  It describes how tables were created and csv files were imported in pgAdmin.

After database construction, the database was analyzed through various [queries](EmployeeSQL/queries.sql).
